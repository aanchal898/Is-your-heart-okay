This repo contains the code for Cardiovascular Disease Detection using data mining and feature engineering techniques. A model is built to detect if a person is at risk of a heart disease using six classifiers. All the classifiers are compared using confusion matrices, precision, recall, F1-score values and ROC curves and also analysed using Principal Component Axes considering 10-folds of dataset.
